23. In this example the cheat code that moves the game character up and down is assigned to the stick up and stick down as conditional execute and the cheat code hover which makes the game character hover in the air is assign to button R which toggles the cheat on/off. The button combos that is bind to code is shown on the left of the cheat label and the code that toggles the cheat on / off is shown on the right of the cheat label. 
7. Some games make full use of every key so holding some key down is at times inconvenient and at other times not practical. There are also cases when most of the time you want the code enabled but occasionally you want to be able to quickly disable it. Moon Jump is very often going to prevent dropping down from platform. A quick way to disable moon jump is a good use case for this feature.

25. Some cheats can be use to create bookmark. Press + and if the cheat can be used to create bookmark a bookmark of the same name will be created.
## Creating outline

28. There is also a button on the main menu to reload cheats. 
29. Using Zing there is no need to restart the game for update to cheat code to take effect. 
# Tips and Tricks
## Change cheat value
1. Some cheat value can be changed on the fly by adding from cheat to bookmark. 
2. After adding to bookmark the value can be edited.
# Known issue
1. Tesla takes up significant amount of memory. It is known for some time now that Tesla and EdiZon applet cannot be running at the same time with some games. The symptom is system freeze requiring long press of pwr button to recover. 
2. Dmnt is set to support only two session. This limit is enforced since atm19. Noexs(my fork) takes up one session. Zing will take one session. EdiZon SE or Breeze will take one session. That would be three so the last one will not be served. The solution is to pick the two you want to use. Exiting Zing (go back to tesla menu will release the session it takes). EdiZon SE or Breeze only takes a session when it is active. Noexs will take one if enabled. I recomment exiting Zing (go back to tesla menu) anyway as a good practice when you want to use any of the other three.
3. Don't unhide any overlay (not juse Zing) if you are making dump with Noexs.
